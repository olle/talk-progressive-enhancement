## Talk

The [Reveal.JS](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js) presentation can
easily be started using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com), as long as you
have a properly setup [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) environment. To
start everyting simply run:

    npm install
    grunt serve

## Demo: Java 8 and Spring MVC

The demo is an annotated sample example application, that shows how
to do progressive enhancement in practice.

The demo application is built using [Maven](http://maven.apache.org),
and uses an embedded [Jetty](http://eclipse.org/jetty/) web server. You
should be able to compile and run it, with the command below, and then
browse to the host and port number that was printed on the command
line.

    mvn jetty:run

Good luck!
